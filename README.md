# Machine-Learning-Articles-and-Lectures
### I have written a series of Machine Learning and Data Science Lectures and articles based on learnings from a course. The lectures are written chronologically starting from introduction to covering all major topics. These lectures are worth reading especially if you are trying to brush up and revise these topics.
